Yeah, yeah...i know...you might think " another snake game... " but i believe that simple things made with best practice can still shine  and be impressive.

THE CONCEPS THAT I USED IN THIS CODE IS:

1. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS:
>>> Each class has your own responsability.

2. ENCAPSULATION:
>>> Each module encapsulates its internal logic.

3. MODULARITY:
>>> Components can be reused, tested and modified indepedently.

4. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:
>>> Centralized configuration in config.js
>>> Easy to modify settings without digging through code

5. Enhanced Maintainability
>>> Easier to debug specific components.
